Abstract
========

Score-based binary classifiers are widely used in machine learning. When it comes to their validation, well-known performance metrics, such as ROC-AUC, F1-score, and Accuracy, are most often used. However, all these metrics have their flaws and represent the performance of the classifier only from a certain angle. This work attempts to aggregate all traditional performance metrics using cognitive diagnosis models. Cognitive diagnosis models are widely researched in smart education and proved to be successful in estimating students' latent knowledge from their exercise solutions. In the context of binary classification, classifiers can be viewed as students and performance metrics as exercises. This reduction represents a novel approach to the validation of binary classifiers and produces latent knowledge attributes, which can be interpreted as new implicit performance attributes.
